    // Similar to the d6 challenge, we want to select a random number between 2 values.

    // Lowest: 0 (index of first item)
    // Highest: whatever the index of the last item is.

    // Let's start by initializing our random number
    var answerIndex = Math.random();

    // We have (inc)0 - 1(exc), but we want (inc)0 - lastIndex(inc)
    // this is, coincidentally, the same thing as:
    // (inc)0 - arrayLength(exc)
